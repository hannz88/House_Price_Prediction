![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7.4-brightgreen)

This repo contains the notebook that displays the machine learning codes I used to predict the housing price. 
The data was provided by Kaggle and can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/data.
Two models were tested: Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.
